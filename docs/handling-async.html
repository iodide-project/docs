# IODIDE<span> â€º WORKING WITH ASYNC</span>

[< back](/)

For users coming from a non-Javascript background, one aspect of JS that is often a source of confusion is working around asynchronous requests.
  Pulling in resources from other servers requires understanding a bit more about how the Event Loop works.

- [The Javascript Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)

%% md
So, if I evaluate two cells that contain these asynchronous calls, we might get an error. Consider the following:

%% js
// click on this cell, then hit shift+enter twice very quickly.
var x = 10
setTimeout(()=>{
  x = 10000
}, 1000)
undefined

%% js
x

%% md
If you hit `shift+enter` twice very quickly, you'll the value of `x` was 10 when we tried to evaluate the above cell, even though under the `setTimeout` the value gets set to `100`.

%% md
Now, sometimes we'll be in the position to pull data asynchronously and do something with it. If you've played with d3 in the browser,
 you'll notice you can't just load data like you can in Python.
 You have to provide a _callback_ to run after the data is pulled.

%% md
Iodide has a handful of functions that makes this all easier so you can get your work done without any hassle.

Below is an example of how to prevent any further cell evaluation until we call `iodide.evalQueue.continue()`.
 Click the cell below and hit `shift+enter` twice, very quickly.

%% js
// click on this cell editor, then hit shift+enter twice quickly.
// you'll notice that we have to wait for this thing to go 5 seconds (5000ms) before we evaluate the cell below.
iodide.evalQueue.requireExplicitContinuation()
var x = 0

new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
  setTimeout(()=> {
    x = 10000
    resolve('done waiting!')
    iodide.evalQueue.continue()
  }, 5000)
})

%% js
x

%% md
Because all the code in this notebook is runnable, being able to delay the evaluation of the next cell makes it possible to run the entire notebook, wait for an asynchronous function to finish, then resume cell evaluation.

%% md
And this cell evaluation delay is exactly how our language plugin works. There's a bunch of async stuff that happens under the hood, and we delay any other cell evaluation until the plugin has loaded everything.

%% plugin
{
  "languageId": "py",
  "displayName": "python",
  "codeMirrorMode": "python",
  "keybinding": "p",
  "url": "https://iodide-project.github.io/pyodide-demo/pyodide.js",
  "module": "pyodide",
  "evaluator": "runPython",
  "pluginType": "language"
}

%% code {"language":"py"}
# python
import sys
sys.version

%% md
Great. So far so good. I would reload this notebook (ctrl+r or cmd+r) now and try "run all cells" (the double triangle that looks like a fast-forward sign on the top left). Everything will run, some things will take a second, but the cell evaluations will be delayed in the instances of `iodide.evalQueue.requireExplicitContinuation()` and `iodide.evalQueue.continue()`.
