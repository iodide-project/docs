## what is jsmd?

While working in an Iodide notebook, you're handling cells in a way similar to a Jupyter notebook. But under the hood, when you save your notebook, we use a format called `jsmd`. So just 
what is this format?

the `jsmd` script type is a flat plaintext format. We modeled it after [`.Rmd`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) files, RMarkdown's notebook format.
In our case, we separate chunks of code and markdown using a delimiter: `%% md` for Markdown, `%% js` for Javascript, `%% css` for CSS, and so on. Take a look at the source of this page
to see an example of `jsmd`.

So, why aren't we just exporting big json files like Jupyter? Well, keeping a flat file format gives a great deal more flexibility, and it makes it much easier to diff between
notebooks to see what might have changed in a document. You can't get that with big json files. And because the point of Iodide is to give you a living, breathing notebook evaluation environment,
this means we have a lot less state to export. Markdown chunks get rendered when a page loads, libraries get requested from cdns, data gets pulled, and so on. So you don't need to save
the kinds of state you do in a Jupyter notebook.

We wrap the `jsmd` string in an HTML document. By doing this, we make it easy to upload your notebook elsewhere, serve it from a web server somewhere, and otherwise give you a lot of 
flexibility about how you share your work. So an Iodide notebook is:

- an html file (take a look at the source of this page for an example!)
- that contains a `jsmd` blob, which has all the cell contents of your analysis
- which is then parsed by the Iodide environment and evaluated.

## How to share an Iodide notebook

Because Iodide notebooks contain everything you need to replicate the data analysis, it might be confusing to figure out how to share your results. If you have a web server somewhere,
you can upload your notebook directly to some directory that serves html, and voila! Your live notebook should be accessible over a URL. Pretty neat, huh?

In other cases, however, you might not have a web server somewhere. So we have some other ways of sharing notebooks. All of the following url tricks
require some static iodide notebook being hosted somewhere. 
Luckily we always keep the most recent build of Iodide here in `master`: [http://iodide-project.github.io/master/](http://iodide-project.github.io/master/)
You're free to use that URL for all these examples.

`?url=<url-to-notebook>` - imports a jsmd-formatted html file directly into your notebook. If a notebook is being served elsewhere, this will parse out the jsmd and put it into Iodide.

`?gist=<gh-username>/<gist-id>` - imports the jsmd-formatted html file saved in a Github gist. We've found this is the fastest way of sharing a publicly-available notebook.

  Example: [`?gist=hamilton/38ee952d60878c45dfcc741b498e555e`](http://iodide-project.github.io/master/?gist=hamilton/38ee952d60878c45dfcc741b498e555e)

`?ipynb=<url-to-ipynb-file>` - imports a Jupyter notebook as jsmd and adds some boilerplate Python language imports. This effectively
makes a large percentage of Jupyter notebooks directly runnable in Iodide using our Empscripten-compiled Python + NumPy + Matplotlib stack without any other servers other than
our CDNs.

  Example: [`?ipynb=<some-ipynb-file>`](http://iodide-project.github.io/master/?ipynb=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdboom/strata-mpl-tutorial/master/Introduction%20to%20matplotlib.ipynb)
